# Crowdfunding ETL Project

## Description
The **Crowdfunding ETL Project** is an educational exercise focused on building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions. This project demonstrates the process of extracting and transforming crowdfunding data, creating meaningful DataFrames, and uploading the data into a Postgres database.

The project encompasses:
- Extracting data from Excel files (`crowdfunding.xlsx` and `contacts.xlsx`).
- Transforming the data into structured formats like `category`, `subcategory`, `campaign`, and `contacts` DataFrames.
- Creating a database schema and importing the structured data into a Postgres database.

Technologies used include Python, Pandas, PostgreSQL, and SQL. The project also emphasizes collaboration and teamwork, as it is designed to be completed with a partner.
